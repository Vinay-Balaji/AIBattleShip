Welcome to the AI Battleship Project! This project represents a modern take on the classic game of Battleship, with the twist of implementing Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the opponent.

The AI Battleship game is a turn-based, strategy game where the goal is to find and sink all of the opponent's ships before they sink yours. This project enhances the game experience by using a self-learning AI that adapts its strategy as the game progresses. This AI uses data from previous turns and games to improve its guessing pattern, making each game more challenging than the last.

Some of the main features of this project include:

Classic Gameplay: Preserves the familiar rules and gameplay of traditional Battleship.

Artificial Intelligence Opponent: The AI opponent improves its strategy over time, providing an increasingly difficult challenge.

Intuitive User Interface: The game offers a clear and easy-to-navigate interface, making it enjoyable for users of all ages and skill levels.

Advanced Testing: The project includes comprehensive unit tests and a rigorous test-driven development methodology, ensuring its reliability and stability.

Customizable Game Parameters: Users can customize the game board size and the types and numbers of ships.
